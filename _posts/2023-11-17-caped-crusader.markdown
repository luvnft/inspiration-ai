quote_image_description: Against a backdrop of countless city lights, Batman stands
  tall atop a skyscraper, his cape fluttering in the night breeze, symbolizing the
  undying call to battle darkness. As rays of light break through the clouds, they
  uncover the scars and shadows that have shaped him, reminding us that our own complex
  journeys enable us to become self-made heroes.
